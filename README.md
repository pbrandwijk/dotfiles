# Dotfiles
Contains the default configuration that I use for standard tools in Linux installations.

## Installation
Make sure that the repository is cloned in the folder `dotfiles` in your `$HOME` directory (`~/`). Then run the following command from within the `dotfiles` folder:

```console
$ ./create_symlinks.sh
```
